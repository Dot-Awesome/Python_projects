                        During my tenure at <strong>L&T Technology Services,</strong> I led a project for the Telangana government, analyzing optical fiber data using Flask. Developing robust algorithms, I extracted insights on consumption and bandwidth from Excel sheets. Collaborating closely with a skilled team, we delivered a tailored Flask solution for efficient telecom infrastructure analysis, enhancing both my Python skills and Flask expertise.
